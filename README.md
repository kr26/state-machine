Spring State Machine working example to demonstrate its functionality. 
To start this application you just need compile and run it.

This application switches initial state of state machine to states: STATE_1 or STATE_2 and back to STATE_1.

To use this application you need send GET request to REST: http://localhost:8080/rest/state/STATE_1

Enjoy! :)
